# Synthetic Data Generation and Profiling with SDV and ydata-profiling
This repository contains scripts for generating synthetic data using the SDV (Synthetic Data Vault) library and for profiling datasets using the ydata-profiling package. The repository includes two main scripts:

## Synthetic Data Generation with CopulaGAN: 
This script demonstrates how to use the CopulaGAN synthesizer from the SDV library to generate synthetic data from a real dataset. It includes steps for loading the dataset, creating metadata, training the synthesizer, generating synthetic data, and saving the synthesizer model and synthetic data.

## Profiling and Comparing Datasets: 
This script reads training and test datasets, generates profiling reports for each, and creates a comparison report to highlight differences and similarities between the datasets.
